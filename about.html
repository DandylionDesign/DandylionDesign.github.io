                        Dandelion design was launched in 2020. Limited to working from home
                        due during lockdown the company was created in a shed built from
                        recycled materails. As dandelions are have an ability to thrive under
                        the most adverse conditions and represent persistence transformation
                        and survival it was an apt name for a company emerging out of a
                        pandemic. The seeds’ journey illustrates a time of letting go, of
                        starting something new and so the story begins.

                        Andrea is a designer and craft person, who works in glass (on its own,
                        and sometimes combined with other materials) to create handmade fused
                        glass pieces. Over the years Andrea has experimented with many
                        materials and enjoyed the endless possibilities there are in combining
                        textures she has grown to love. Whether its timber, metal, leather,
                        flint, plaster or something more obscure; there is a distinctive
                        relationship she has with them all; and a respect for their
                        limitations and potential. However she is now fully immersed in a love
                        affair glass.
