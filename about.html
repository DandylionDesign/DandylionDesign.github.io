                    <h3>About the artist</h3>
                    <p>
                        Andrea is a designer and crafts person who works in glass (on its own, and sometimes combined with other materials), to create handmade fused glass pieces.
                        Over the years Andrea has experimented with many materials and enjoyed the endless possibilities created by combining textures she has grown to love. 
                        Whether its timber, metal, leather, flint, plaster or something more obscure, there is a distinctive relationship she has with them all; 
                        and a respect for their limitations and potential.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She is now fully immersed in a love affair with glass. Every unique item is designed and handmade in her Essex based studio.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "I've always loved glass, it's alchemy lends itself to a three-dimensional depth of colour. 
                        There's so much to learn and so many ideas I want to put into practice. 
                        I think it's safe to assume my kiln will have a long and hard life."

                    <h3>About Dandelion design</h3>
                    <p>
                        Dandelion Design was launched in 2020 working from home during lockdown. 
                        The company was created in a shed built from recycled materials. As dandelions have an ability to thrive 
                        under the most adverse conditions and represent persistence, transformation and survival, 
                        it was an apt name for a company emerging through a pandemic. 
                        The seed's journey illustrates a time of letting go, of starting something new. 
                        And so the story begins.
                    </p>
